TASK 1
Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
A basic chatbot created using if-else statements and pattern matching to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules. This project demonstrates core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversation flow by recognizing user queries and providing appropriate responses. Ideal for beginners learning chatbot development and conversational AI basics.

TASK 2
Tic-Tac-Toe AI
An AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI agent competes against a human player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, optionally enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning, to make unbeatable moves. This project introduces concepts in game theory and basic search algorithms, making it a great starting point for learning about AI decision-making in turn-based games.

TASK 5
Face Detection and Recognition
An AI application for detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. This project leverages pre-trained face detection models, such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based detectors, to accurately locate faces. Additionally, it includes optional face recognition capabilities using advanced techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace. This project serves as a practical introduction to computer vision and facial recognition.
